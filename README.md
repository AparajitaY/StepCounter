# StepCounter
This repository contains Verilog HDL source code for a FPGA based embedded system that works as a pedometer. Includes modules for each function and uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture. The step counter tracks user steps by processing signals from a tilt sensor, which detects changes in orientation and movement. The project highlights practical digital design techniques and FPGA-based embedded system implementation.
