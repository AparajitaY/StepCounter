# StepCounter
This repository contains Verilog HDL source code for a FPGA based embedded system that works as a pedometer. It includes modules for each function and uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture. The step counter tracks user steps by processing signals from a tilt sensor, which detects changes in orientation and movement. The project highlights practical digital design techniques and FPGA-based embedded system implementation.

The project consists of eight Verilog HDL modules: step_counter module serves as the top-level integration file by coordinating all submodules; bin_to_bcd handles binary-to-BCD conversion for display; debounce_sync cleans and synchronizes tilt sensor signals; goal_alert raises alerts upon reaching decided step goals; sevenseg_driver manages step count visualization on 4 seven-segment displays; step_count_logic implements logic to interpret valid step events; step_fsm captures movement events using a FSM; and tb_step_counter serves as the testbench for simulation and verification on the FPGA board.
